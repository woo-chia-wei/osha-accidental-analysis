Using the table saw  Employee #1 ripped the  0.75-inch-thick (19-millimeter-thick) plywood for the custodian. Employee #1  turned off the equipment after ripping the piece.

The Division issued one Serious Accident-Related citation  alleging  violation of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR)  section  4300.1 (c)  for the employer's failure to provide the saw with a hood  guard  or other device(s) designed to prevent a kick back while its employee was  ripping pieces. The Division also issued two General citations for the  employer's failure to ensure that the saw was guarded by a hood that  completely enclosed the portion of the saw blade  in that the hood was cracked  and/or broken  violation of T8 CCR  section 4300.1 (a); and implement and  maintain an effective Injury and Illness Prevention Program in that the  employer had no written inspection record(s) documenting the presence of a  crack or hole on the saw guard for the saw and its planned corrective action   until it was repaired on July 5  2013  violation of T8 CCR  section 3203 (a).   ,    carpenter  saw  table saw  blade  unguarded  kick back  struck by  board  abdomen , ,"April 1 2013, July 5 2013, April 22 2013","CCR, City and County of San Francisco Airport Commission, Division of Occupational Safety and Health, Facilities Maintenance Division, Peninsula Medical Center","10:20 a.m., fifteen seconds later, 6:00 a.m., 1:53 p.m.","California, San Francisco Airport"
